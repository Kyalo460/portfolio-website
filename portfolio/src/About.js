        Hi there! I'm a passionate frontend developer who recently completed a twelve month program at ALX SE, 
        where I immersed myself in hands-on projects, focusing 70% of my time on building real-world solutions 
        rather than theoretical concepts. During this journey, I specialized in frontend development and honed 
        my skills in React, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, allowing me to craft responsive, user-friendly websites.

      <h2 className="intro">
        I thrive on challenges and continuously seek opportunities to improve my craft. 
        Each bug I encounter is an exciting new lesson, and I handle every obstacle as a 
        chance to learn and grow. My goal is to create intuitive, high-performance websites 
        that adapt to any device, ensuring the best user experience possible.
